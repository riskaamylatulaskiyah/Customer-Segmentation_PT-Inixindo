# Customer-Segmentation_PT-Inixindo
This repository contains the project materials for Customer Segmentation, aimed at unlocking insights from sales data to understand customer behavior and preferences. The project encompasses data analysis, visualization, and clustering techniques to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing patterns.


# Contents:

Presentation Slides: The PowerPoint presentation slides provide a comprehensive overview of the project, including objectives, background, dataset overview, data understanding, preprocessing, analysis, visualization, insights, and recommendations.
Data Analysis Scripts: Python scripts used for data preprocessing, analysis, and customer segmentation. These scripts utilize popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
Visualization Outputs: Visualizations generated from the analysis, including scatter plots, histograms, and heat maps, showcasing customer segments, top purchased products, sales amount vs order quantity, order quantity distribution, sales amount distribution, and customer demography by reseller type.
README.MD: This file provides instructions for reproducing the analysis, running the scripts, and understanding the project's objectives and insights. It also outlines the repository's contents and offers suggestions for future directions.
Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to provide actionable insights for better decision-making by segmenting customers and understanding their preferences. These insights contribute to optimizing marketing strategies, improving customer satisfaction, and enhancing business performance.

# Key Insights:

Customer Segmentation identified three distinct groups based on total purchases: Cluster 0 (Low total purchases), Cluster 1 (Moderate total purchases), and Cluster 2 (High total purchases).
Analysis of top purchased products reveals customer preferences, guiding inventory management and marketing efforts.
Visualizations of sales amount vs order quantity, order quantity distribution, sales amount distribution, and customer demography by reseller type offer valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
Future Directions:

Future work could involve refining segmentation strategies, incorporating additional data sources for deeper analysis, and implementing real-time monitoring to adapt strategies dynamically. Additionally, exploring advanced machine learning techniques for more nuanced segmentation could further enhance the project's outcomes.
